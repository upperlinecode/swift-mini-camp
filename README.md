## General Goals: 
- Students will create their first swift program
- Students will learn about swift data types, constants and variables, and operations
- Students will create conditional branches in their code.
- Students will complete an iPhone application


## SWBATs
- download Xcode
- understand the purpose of Xcode and the idea of a compiler
- understand the difference between Integer, Double, String, and Boolean data types 
- understand the difference between using a constant and a variable
- demonstrate type annotation, understand it is unneccesary because of type inference
- follow convention for naming variables
- print data to the Xcode console
- understand what a code comment is and how to write them
- execute mathmatical operations in swift: +, -, *, /, %, also boolean operators
