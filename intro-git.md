##Git and Github

####Background
Git is a free, open-sourced version-control system that anyone can use to manage a project. It's a really safe way for a team of people to all work on the same files and folders without worrying about losing your work or not having the most up-to-date version of the project.

####Getting Today's Materials from Github
All of the materials that we're going to use today are stored in Upperlinecode's Github account in a repository called [swift-mini-camp](https://github.com/upperlinecode/swift-mini-camp). A repository is just a git folder that holds a project.

In order to take this code and put it on your computer, you can *clone* the repository in your terminal.

1. Open your terminal application
2. Type "ls" and hit enter. This shows all of the files and folders in your home directory. It should look something like this:
3. Go to the repository for today's material on [github](https://github.com/upperlinecode/swift-mini-camp). Click this clipboard to copy the link you'll need to clone this repository onto your computer.
4. In the terminal, enter 
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/upperlinecode/swift-mini-camp.git
```
