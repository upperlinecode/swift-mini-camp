##Git and Github

####Background
Git is a free, open-sourced version-control system that anyone can use to manage a project. It's a really safe way for a team of people to all work on the same files and folders without worrying about losing your work or not having the most up-to-date version of the project.

####Getting Today's Materials from Github
All of the materials that we're going to use today are stored in Upperlinecode's Github account in a repository called [swift-mini-camp](https://github.com/upperlinecode/swift-mini-camp). A repository is just a git folder that holds a project.

In order to take this code and put it on your computer, you can *clone* the repository in your terminal.

1) Open your terminal application <br>
2) Type "ls" and hit enter. This shows all of the files and folders in your home directory. It should look something like this: <br>
3) Go to the repository for today's material on [github](https://github.com/upperlinecode/swift-mini-camp). Click this clipboard to copy the link you'll need to clone this repository onto your computer. <br>
4) In the terminal, enter <br>
```
git clone https://github.com/upperlinecode/swift-mini-camp.git
```
This is what the output should look like after you hit enter:
5) Use the ls command again to view the contents of your home directory. You should now see the folder "swift-mini-camp" listed. <br>
6) Type in the change directory command (cd) followed by the name of the folder to enter into the swift-mini-camp folder <br>
```
cd swift-mini-camp/
```
7) Use the ls command to see the contents of the swift-mini-camp directory. The files and folders should be the same as the ones that you saw on the remote Github page. <br>
